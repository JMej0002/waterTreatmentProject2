\section{Introduction and Conceptual Design Description}
Population and economical growth among other factors require the subsequently development of cities and the
general infrastructure that supports them. As a cities expand, the electrical grid, road systems, drinking water and Wastewater
recolection and treatment, among others, need to increase their capabilities as well. In the recent years, a northwest area in
Melbourne has been rapidly developping and therefore, requires the construction of a new Wastewater treatment plant that can 
address the current and future needs of the community. In the presente report, the authors present the design of the abovementioned
plant following local guidlines.

\subsection{Population estimations}

To determine the waswater flowrates and mass loads for develoment areas that the plant should be capable of process, 
where actual flow and load
measurements are not avilable, the population equivalent can be used. This is a standarization of the wastewater production
and characteristics based on the amount of people that would produce the same values. For example, in the
\textit{AMF L8 Sewerage Planning and Design Principles}
 which is the standard for wastewater treatment plants, developed by 
 \textit{Yarra Valley Water}
  which covers the area underdesign in the present report, on 
\textit{Table 3-4}
 equivalent population factors are presented for different development types for both residential and commercial use. 
For this report, based on previous surveys and analysis, it is known that the equivalent population from 
domestic contributions (\(PE_{\mathrm{domestic}}\)) is equal to 340000.
Similarly, for commercial contributions, the equivalent population is known to comply with the 
following calculation: 
% BEGIN py_Population
\(PE_{\mathrm{commercial}}
= \bigl\lceil \sqrt{\text{10}}\times 9000 \bigr\rceil
=  \text{28461} \).
% END py_Population

\subsection{Current flowrates estimation}

According to the \textit{Water Service Association of Australia} the inflow rate percapita
can be estimated as 
% BEGIN py_DomesticPerCapitaFlowrate
180
% END py_DomesticPerCapitaFlowrate
L/PE/day \cite{yarravalleywater_2023_amf}. Therefore, the 
\( Q_{\text{current avg, domestic}} \) can be calculated as\\
% BEGIN py_DomesticCurrentFlow
\(\frac{Q_{\text{domestic per capita}} \times PE_{\text{domestic}}}{1000}= 61200.0\)
% END py_DomesticCurrentFlow
\(\mathrm{m^3/day}\).
Similarly, based on previous surveys it got determine that the commercial contribution for this area is
280 L/PE/day. Therefore the 
\( Q_{\text{current avg, commercial}} \) can be calculated as
% BEGIN py_CommercialCurrentFlow
\(\frac{Q_{\text{commercial per capita}} \times PE_{\text{commercial}}}{1000}= 7969.08\)
% END py_CommercialCurrentFlow
\(\mathrm{m^3/day}\).\\
\\
The infiltration/inflow flowrate, when no data is available, can be estimated based on either the
total length of the sewer system, or based on the area to be covered. For the last one, the ratio can vary
from 0.2 up to 28 \(\mathrm{m^3/ha/day}\) \cite{metcalf_2014_wastewater}. In this report, the authors
has choosen the lower limit as the system will be new and therefore the damage on the pipelines will be
minimum. 

As no data of the covered area is available, the autors have estimated it based on the average
population per area ratio of Melbourne suburbs. The Melbourne population density per suburb data is available in the 
\textit{Australian Bureau of Statistics} web page, see Apendix  \ref{app:melbourne_density} for the raw data.
From it, the Population average per suburb ( \(P_{\text{average}}\) ) and the average landscape area (\(A_{average}\) \(\mathrm{km^2}\))
were calculated. With the \(P_{\text{average}}\) / \(A_{average}\) ratio, multiplied by the \(PE_{\mathrm{domestic}}\)
the estimated area of the understudy suburb (\(A_{estimated}\)) is obtained. The \(PE_{\mathrm{commercial}}\) is not included
as it does not represents actual population. In the Table \ref{tab:und_study_area} the obtained results for the infiltration 
rate estimation. In the Table \ref{tab:current_flows} the current flow rates obtained are summarized.\\

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{Understudy landscape area estimation}
  \label{tab:und_study_area}
  \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  $P_{\text{average}}$ & $A_{\text{average}}$ (km$^2$) & $A_{\text{average}} / P_{\text{average}}$ & $A_{\text{estimated}}$ (km$^2$) & Ratio (m$^3$/ha/day) & $Q_{\text{infiltration}}$ (m$^3$/day) \\
  \hline
% BEGIN py_areaContent
  11200.0 & 18.65 & 0.0017 & 5.66 & 0.2 & 11323.41 \\
% END py_areaContent
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Minimum current flow rates}

The minimum flow rates can be estimated using the minimum peaking factor
which from the \ref{fig:peaking_factor} is equal to 0.3. The current flow rates shown in the Table \ref{tab:current_flows}
are multiplied by this factor, see results in \textbf{INSERT RESULTS TABLE REF}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../images/peaking_factor.png}
  \caption{Daily fluctuation of peaking factors at each hour of the day for flow rates on an average day in a similar wastewater catchment.}
  \label{fig:peaking_factor}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Maximum current flow rates}

The maximum flow rates can be estimated using the maximum peaking factor
which from the \ref{fig:peaking_factor} is equal to 1.9. The current flow rates shown in the Table \ref{tab:current_flows}
are multiplied by this factor, see results in \textbf{INSERT RESULTS TABLE REF} 

\subsection*{Population Growth and Future Design Considerations}

To account for future demand on the wastewater treatment plant, the design incorporates a projected population 
growth. Based on previous analysis, it was determined that 
the annual growth reate can be estimated as: \(G_{rate} = 1 + 10^{0.015} =2.04\%\).
The current population is therefore projected during the life span of the plant. The life span is 
commonly adopted as 20 years as it balances the need to consider future growth and 
technological advancements while ensuring economic feasibility \cite{wef_DesignWaterResource}.
The projected population can be calculated based on \eqref{eq:population_projection}. 


\begin{align}
  \refstepcounter{equation}
  PE_{\text{projected}} = \left\lceil PE \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Growth Percentage}}{100} \right)^{20} \right\rceil 
  \tag{Eq.~\theequation} \label{eq:population_projection}
\end{align}


\noindent Additionally, a **climate change factor** of 1.2 was adopted based on published long-term projections. This factor accounts for increased intensity and frequency of rainfall events and their impact on infiltration and inflow volumes.
